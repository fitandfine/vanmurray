            <h2>About the Developer</h2>
            <p>I am an international student here in Auckland studying Master in Software Engineering at Yoobee College of Creative Innovations.<br>
                 He had inspired me and I wanted to pay him back for his good vibes. Tragedy, I am just a student without an income. <br>
                 Thus, this is my effort to help my friend spreading happiness with his music. This is my sunday funday project on 1st September, 2024.<br>
                 Thank you for supporting them. You can contact me via Instagram or email if you need some simple software solutions. <br>
                 And oh, My name is Anup & I am from Nepal: the country of the mount EVEREST! I am in love with New Zealand and people here.</p>
